# Test

I started the test by doing a console app. 
Only after  realised that I was suposed to do a lambda, so I changed to an AWS lambda project.

Since the test is bery simple, I coinstrain my self to do the minimal necessary to make it work and inside of the hour like requested.

All the steps I did are reflected on the commit history, so you can check my approach and how I did it.

In order to compile and run the tests you can find a readme inside of the folder of the lambda project (is the default readme created by AWS but contains all the required steps).
